# Customer Personality Analysis Project 📊👥

Welcome to my project on Customer Personality Analysis, where I dive deep into the intricacies of customer preferences and behaviors, aiming to reshape how products are developed and marketed. This journey into data analytics showcases my dedication to unlocking actionable insights from complex datasets.

## Project Overview 🌐

In this project, I embark on an analytical expedition to segment customers based on their distinct personalities, preferences, and purchasing behaviors. The goal? To enable a more personalized, effective approach to product development and targeted marketing.

## Highlights ✨

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Kicked off the project with a comprehensive EDA to decode patterns and relationships within the data.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensured robustness through meticulous handling of missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Elevated our model's predictive capabilities by transforming raw data into insightful features.
- **K-means Clustering:** Implemented this technique to identify homogeneous customer groups, utilizing the silhouette score method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Strategic Insights:** Developed a segmentation model that pinpoints customer segments likely to engage with new products, optimizing marketing spend and boosting customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used 🛠

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for K-means clustering and silhouette score analysis

## Key Outcomes 🏆

- Achieved a silhouette score of approximately 54, indicating a moderately strong cluster structure.
- Enabled the business to target specific customer segments, enhancing the efficiency of marketing strategies and aligning product offerings with customer needs.

## Running the Project 🚀

The Jupyter Notebook (`Customer Segmentation.ipynb`) contains all the code and analyses. Here’s how to get it running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for a cloud-based option.
3. Install all required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (a requirements file should be created if not existing).
4. Open `Customer Segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Colab and run the cells sequentially.
